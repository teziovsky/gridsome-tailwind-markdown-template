## Files to change:

### Set your Site Name

```js{codeTitle: "gridsome.config.js"}
module.exports = {
  siteName: 'WriteYourNameHere',
  siteUrl: 'https://WriteYourDomainHere.com', //Used by the sitemap plugin to make your site searchable on Google.
  //...
};
```

### Set the Base URL for calculating Canonical URLs
> This is important because it will dictate what the canonical url is for your blog posts!

```js{codeTitle: "gridsome.server.js"}
module.exports = function(api) {
  api.loadSource(async (store) => {
    store.addMetadata("baseURL", "https://WriteYourDomainHere.com");
  });
  //...
};
```

### Reroute from my Twitter profile to yours for shared posts

```vue{codeTitle: "/src/templates/Post.vue"}
<script>
        {
          name: "twitter:creator",
          content: "@YourTwitterName",
        },
        {
          name: "twitter:site",
          content: "@YourTwitterName",
        },
</script>
```

### Update the Site Favicon

```js{codeTitle: "/src/favicon.png"}
// Replace this with an image to use as the favicon for your site!
```

> ðŸš¨ If you use a file name other than favicon.png you need to update gridsome.config.js with the icon property: https://gridsome.org/docs/config/#icon

## Blog Posts

### Adding New Blog Posts

To add new blog posts, create `postTitle.md` files in the `/blog/` root level folder.

The first thing in each of your blog post markdown file should be the following information which is required for the site to build:

```md{codeTitle: "/blog/yourMarkdownFile.md"}

> The `date_published` is in YYYY-MM-DD format so that the blog list on the home page can be sorted with the newest items at the top of the page.

> Note that the title of the post is automatically added as the h1 tag on the post page and all markdown content should start at the `##heading 2` level to prevent accessibility issues.

> `og_image` is the image that will show when the link is shared in places like Facebook or Twitter
